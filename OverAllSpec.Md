# Specification Document for a Relational Database System in C #

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of a relational database management system (RDBMS) in C#. The system will support SQL queries, utilize B-Tree data structures for efficient lookups, store table data in binary files, and provide a server-client architecture with a graphical client interface.

## 2. System Requirements

- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET
- **Supported Platforms**: Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Database Storage**: Binary files
- **Data Structures**: B-Tree for indexing
- **Client Interface**: GUI with a list of tables, SQL editor, and results view

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 SQL Support

- **SQL Syntax**: The system will support a subset of SQL similar to Microsoft T-SQL.
- **Query Execution**: SQL queries will be parsed and executed against the binary-stored data tables.

### 3.2 B-Tree Lookups

- **Primary Key**: B-Tree structures will be used for efficient lookup of primary keys in each table.
- **Primary-Foreign Key Relationships**: Separate B-Tree structures will be maintained for optimizing lookups of foreign keys in relationships.

### 3.3 Index Support

- **Indexes**: Users can define indexes on table columns. These indexes will be stored in separate binary files and will also use B-Tree structures for efficient lookups.

## 4. Data Storage

### 4.1 File Structure

- **Table Structure File**: Each table will have a corresponding file describing its structure (columns, data types, primary keys, etc.).
- **Data File**: Binary file storing the actual data for the table.
- **Primary Key B-Tree File**: Binary file storing the B-Tree structure for primary key lookups.
- **Index Files**: Separate binary files for each index defined on the table.
- **Relationship Files**: Files for storing B-Tree structures related to foreign key relationships.

### 4.2 Binary File Format

- **Structure**: All files will store data in binary format to ensure efficiency in storage and retrieval.
- **Consistency**: Transactions will be used to maintain data consistency across files.

## 5. Server Program

### 5.1 Functionality

- **Connection Management**: The server will handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **Query Execution**: The server will parse SQL queries, execute them, and return results to the client.
- **Transaction Management**: The server will support transactional operations to ensure data integrity.
- **Logging**: Server will log all operations for auditing and debugging purposes.

### 5.2 Architecture

- **Thread Management**: The server will use multi-threading to handle concurrent client connections.
- **Security**: Basic authentication mechanisms will be provided to restrict unauthorized access.

## 6. Client Application

### 6.1 GUI Design

- **Left Panel**: A list of tables within the connected database, allowing users to select and explore table structures.
- **Right Panel (Editor)**: A text editor for writing and executing SQL queries.
- **Bottom Panel (Results View)**: A grid-based results view for displaying the output of executed queries.

### 6.2 Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: SQL keywords, functions, and operators will be highlighted in the editor.
- **Auto-complete**: Suggestions for table names, column names, and SQL keywords.
- **Error Reporting**: Display errors related to SQL syntax or execution in real-time.
- **Query History**: A history of executed queries, allowing users to easily re-run or modify previous queries.

### 6.3 Client-Server Communication

- **Protocol**: The client will communicate with the server using a custom protocol over TCP/IP.
- **Data Format**: Results and messages will be transmitted in a binary or serialized format to optimize performance.

## 7. Development Plan

### 7.1 Phase 1: Core Database Engine

- **SQL Parsing and Execution**
- **B-Tree Implementation for Primary Keys**
- **Basic Binary File Storage**

### 7.2 Phase 2: Indexes and Relationships

- **Index Support Implementation**
- **Foreign Key Relationship Management**
- **Binary File Handling for Indexes and Relationships**

### 7.3 Phase 3: Server Implementation

- **Client Connection Handling**
- **Query Execution and Transaction Management**
- **Security and Logging**

### 7.4 Phase 4: Client Application

- **GUI Design and Implementation**
- **Editor and Results View**
- **Client-Server Communication**

### 7.5 Phase 5: Testing and Optimization

- **Unit and Integration Testing**
- **Performance Optimization**
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

## 8. Testing

- **Unit Testing**: All components will undergo rigorous unit testing.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly.
- **Performance Testing**: Test the database under various load conditions.
- **Security Testing**: Verify the systemï¿½s resistance to unauthorized access.

## 9. Deployment

- **Packaging**: The system will be packaged for easy installation on supported platforms.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation will be provided for both developers and end-users.
- **Support**: Initial support will be provided for troubleshooting and bug fixes post-deployment.

## 10. Future Enhancements

- **Advanced SQL Features**: Support for more complex SQL operations like JOINs, subqueries, and advanced functions.
- **Replication and Sharding**: Support for distributed databases.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Tools for database backup and recovery.
- **Optimized Query Execution**: Further optimization of query execution strategies and caching mechanisms.
